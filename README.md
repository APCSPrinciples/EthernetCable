# Make your own Ethernet Cable
In this lab you will make a Cat 5e ethernet cable that is yours to keep and take home. You might want to look around your house to see if you need an Ethernet cable of a particular length to reduce cable clutter.
 
Before you start, read over the [instructions] and video.
 
There is nothing to turn in for this lab, just hook your cable up to the cable tester and show your instructor that your cable tests correctly.
