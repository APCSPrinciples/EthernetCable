# Make your own Ethernet Cable
In this lab you will make a Cat 5e ethernet cable that is yours to keep and take home. You might want to look around your house to see if you need an Ethernet cable of a particular length to reduce cable clutter.
 
Before you start, read over the [instructions](https://github.com/APCSPrinciples/APCSPrinciples.github.io/blob/master/Worksheets/MakeYourOwnEthernetCableLab.docx?raw=true) and watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lullzS740wI).
 
There is nothing to turn in for this lab, just hook your cable up to the cable tester and show your instructor that your cable tests correctly.
 
Optional: If you have extra time, you can also make a Cat 6 Ethernet cable. You can read more about making a Cat 6 cable [here](https://www.handymanhowto.com/how-to-wire-a-cat6-rj45-ethernet-plug/).
